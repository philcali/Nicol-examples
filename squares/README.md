# Flying Squares

You control the blue in square in a terrifying and addictive game
where you must consume the green squares for points and avoid the
red squares to survive.

Some interesting things to point out:

  * The use of `Scene` for game state
  * Accessing specific mouse events viathe `Mouse` object (clicking)

Here's a screenshot:
